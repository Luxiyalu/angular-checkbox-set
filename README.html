<h1>angular-checkbox-set</h1>

<p>Angular directive, with recursive support for multiple layers of checkboxes.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>checked</code> status would be stored in a unique object for each checkbox. This attribute is mandatory.</li>
<li>The <code>hook</code> and <code>hooked-to</code> attributes are optional. <code>hook</code> act as a hook, <code>hooked-to</code> hook the checkbox to the filled-in hook.</li>
<li>A checkbox could have both <code>hook</code> and <code>hooked-to</code> attributes, which means:</li>
<li>You could have as many levels of checkboxes as you like.</li>
<li>No need to initialise all the checkboxes at the same time: you could put children checkboxes inside <code>ng-if</code>s and when they come into existence, they&rsquo;ll automatically follow the status of their parent.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Install</h3>

<p><code>command
$ bower install angular-checkbox-set
</code></p>

<h3>Directive Attributes</h3>

<ol>
<li><code>hook</code>, string. <strong>Notice the single quote within double quote!</strong></li>
<li><code>hooked-to</code>, string. Same as above.</li>
<li><code>status-stored-in</code>, scope object.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Code Example</h3>

<p>```html</p>

<!-- provide a hook string for its children -->


<!-- gpObj will have a property "checked", its value would be boolean -->


<p><checkbox hook="'grandParent'" status-stored-in="gpObj"></checkbox></p>

<!-- since these two are hooked to 'grandParent' -->


<!-- 1. checking parentA would auto check these two -->


<!-- 2. unchecking parentA would auto uncheck these two -->


<!-- 3. unchecking either of these would uncheck their hook 'grandParent' -->


<!-- 4. if these two are checked, their hook 'grandParent' would be checked -->


<p><checkbox hook="'parentA'" hooked-to="'grandParent'" status-stored-in="pObjA"></checkbox>
<checkbox hook="'parentB'" hooked-to="'grandParent'" status-stored-in="pObjB"></checkbox></p>

<!-- you could link the hooks recursively, and they don't have to be placed in a inherited structure in html -->


<p><checkbox hooked-to="'parentA'" status-stored-in="cObjA1"></checkbox>
<checkbox hooked-to="'parentA'" status-stored-in="cObjA2"></checkbox>
```</p>
